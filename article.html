            <p class="p1"> <span class="firstcharacter">I</span> t was 1 AM on a Saturday morning, and I was standing paralyzed with my hands gripping the hem of my shirt, surrounded by the rhythmic sounds of waves crashing and 29 other people quietly murmuring while stripping off their clothes. I glanced out of the exit of the dimly lit dressing room, and caught a glimpse of one of the hot spring pools perched on the edge of the landing, overlooking a precipitous drop to the ocean under a dazzling starry sky. Fuck it, I thought, and pulled my shirt off.

    <p>I ended up at the Esalen Institute through an odd combination of meticulous research and total spontaneity.

        Something important to know about me - I’m a chronic color-coding, list-making planner (I actually use a physical paper planner to color-code my days and to-dos). For me, half of the fun that comes from going on a trip or exploring an area is spread over a month or two of planning out my itinerary and compiling endless lists of collated recommendations and ideas, trying to find a perfect mix of unknown spots and the big must-dos.
        
        <br>  <br>  I’ve lived in Berkeley for almost three years and in California all my life, yet somehow I’ve never been to Big Sur. So I decided to start pulling together a trip, and on one of many research binges I found the Esalen Institute.
        
        The Esalen Institute is, politely, a mindfulness center that runs workshops and retreats with the big draw of cliffside hot springs. While I’m not really into this hippy dippy kind of stuff (and don’t have $420 to blow on “sleeping bag” accommodations for one of their weekend workshops), their night bathing program caught my interest.
        
        While most of Esalen’s facilities are closed unless you go for one of these workshops ($1505 for a single room for a weekend‽) they open up their cliffside hot springs from 1 AM - 3 AM in the morning to the public.        <br> <br>  I have to do this, I thought, clicking through pages of TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews.
        
        Then I found two kickers. First only same-day reservations are available. Reservations open up at 9 AM every morning for that night (technically the next morning); there are 30 spots, and there’s no way to book ahead. This meant that I’d have to pick a random Friday or Saturday, try for a reservation, and if successful then pack up and drive down to Big Sur that same night with no accommodations - from Berkeley, three and a half hours away.
        
        My inner planner shriveled up and died a little at the sheer spontaneity of it all.
        
        The second kicker: it was clothing-optional, and apparently most people chose to birthday suit it. Yikes. When I go to the gym, I change behind the cover of a towel. I can barely psych myself into a two-piece or into shorts. Review after review: oh, we were worried about it, but we got there and it was fine! \ everyone does it, so you feel more awkward if you don’t join in \ it’s dark anyways, you don’t see anything unless you’re trying to look. Gah. I put it, and the trip, out of my mind.
        
        Fast forward to the Friday of the second to last week of my internship. The semester was starting up again soon, and I was going home before the start of the year. It was a week after Mars’ closest pass to Earth, a week before the Perseid meteor shower, and the night of a third quarter moon - truly stellar conditions. I got into work early that Friday and sat down at my desk: it was now or never.

        <br> <br>  
        
        It was 11 PM that night and I was two hours into a whiteknuckled drive, with the roads getting progressively darker and darker the further I drove. I had passed the last dregs of civilization in Monterey and now streetlights were but a vague memory as I drove through the darkness with only my headlights illuminating the road. Maybe not the best decision to drive this for the first time in the dark - carefully navigating a hairpin turn with unknown cliffs dropping to my right and steep rock faces rising to my left. I could only tell that the ocean was there from the absence of trees or rocks, and inferred the presence of the hills by the stars dancing in and out of my vision as I sped along.
        
        I arrived at Esalen half an hour early, got out of the car and closed the door and - bam. Above me stretched a 150 degree view of the milky way cartwheeling from the ocean to the faintly outlined hills. I stood there as cars sporadically pulled into the lot, leaning against the car with my neck craned back and watching the occasional meteor shoot by, to the soundtrack of distant waves and seals.
        
        <br> <br>  
        
        Around 12:45 AM, a no-nonsense employee appeared to give us all a prerequisite safety talk.
        
        “I can smell the weed. One of you is high - I know you’re high, everyone else knows you’re high,” he started, with the longsuffering air of a retail employee explaining for the thousandth time that even if a barcode doesn’t scan, you still have to pay. I looked around. Frankly, from the amount of coughing I’d heard since arriving, the offending group may have been too high to physically respond. “Mixing substances and hot water is dangerous. There’s no shame in backing out now.” Nobody moved.
        
        With that auspicious start, he sent everyone back to their car to grab water and a towel and to store any valuables. I hesitated, and stuffed my swimsuit bottoms into my jacket pocket. Better safe than instantly regretful.
        
        <br> <br>   We navigated down a steep hill and across the main facilities, which looked a cross between zen garden and spa in the woods. Then, down a short flight of stairs, opening up onto a dirt path lit in soft geometric patterns and a drop to the ocean immediately next to us. I walked quietly behind our guide, the rest of the group trailing off behind me in soft murmurs. There was something ethereal and surreal permeating the atmosphere, and I was loathe to break the silence with even the crunching of my footsteps (or perhaps I was just sleep-deprived).
        
        At the end of the path and our guide gave us some more rules - no photography, no sexual activity (thank god, take that couples!), etc. Some poor sod complained about not being given a towel, and the prices, and the photography rule ... and the guide shut him down pretty fast. I stuffed my hands into my pockets and worried about the upcoming clothing debacle.
        
        And finally, we were in. “Looks like we know who was high,” the guide murmured to me as we walked inside a hallway leading to the dressing rooms. “That guy was out of it.” 
        
        <br> <br>  I stared at him, images of swimsuits dancing through my head. “Huh? Oh yeah, sure.” I replied, and ducked into the bathroom. Great, now he thinks I’m high.
        
        I made it to the dressing room a couple minutes later, and there were naked people everywhere - showering, changing, heading out to the hot springs. Alright. Jacket, shoes, leggings. I glanced around, gripping my shirt. Everyone else there was going about their own thing - the stars and water beckoned. 
        
        <br> <br>   I went for it.

        <br> <br>  
        I padded out to the outdoor area after a quick rinse. Esalen has some larger pools and some individual ones (literally bathtubs sitting out there). The best spots are the pools down a short set of stairs, completely under the stars and right on the edge of a cliff. I made my way over and sunk down into the sulfury water, next to the cliffs edge.
        
        I sat in the waters, moving from pool to pool as the night progressed. The moon was hidden behind the towering coastal hills; Mars shone bright and red, and the stars slowly turned above me. Every few minutes, a white-hot streak sprinted across the sky, burning a bright afterimage into my eyes. Quiet murmurs of conversation rose around me, and the pounding of barely visible waves on the rocky shore lent an even, calm tempo to the night. Between the tub and the ocean was a tiny concrete ledge and some corded metal strings to stop an accidental fall - when I sat on the side of the pool, my legs dangled above the ocean, far below. The line between sky and water was distinguishable only by a lack of stars at the horizon. Trying to delineate between the two was near impossible, and I soon gave up trying. It was ethereal and impossibly serene, and the closest to a spiritual experience I’ve ever had.       <br> <br>  
        
        Most of the conversations around me were quiet and unintelligible, but there was one particular couple (isn’t there always?) who spent the entire time arguing. Normally I wouldn’t have minded and just moved away, but they were in the best spot in the least crowded pool (partly because people kept leaving because of their arguments), so I stuck around for a while. 
        
        <br> <br>  I floated, overlooking the ocean with my head pillowed on my arms, as they argued about issues that had never seemed pettier to me than in that moment. “Another thing I don’t like about you,” half of the couple, a girl, continued, “is that you’re closed off.” I looked up at Mars, our closest neighbor. 
        
        <br> <br>  “I’ll share parts of myself when I’m ready to share,” the guy responded. The waves crashed below us.
        
        <br> <br>   “Fine. Another thing about me is that I don’t trust easily. You need to work on that and make me trust you. I have trust issues,” she continued. Meteors streaked above us, and everyone in the surrounding pools paused their conversations for a moment and looked up, except for them. “This is something you need to work on, because I just don’t trust you, and I’m upset you haven’t been working on it.”
        
        Eventually, I switched pools and later returned to this one, and they were still going at it.
        
        <br> <br>   I couldn’t understand where they were finding this energy. All my hang-ups about swimsuits, the drive, coming alone - they all vanished as soon as I settled into the water. I was struck with how much we still don’t know, gazing upon the vast expanse of blackness of the ocean and the galaxy as I floated down below, a small human speck in the immense unknown. It put a lot of my worries in perspective, but at the same time this argument kept me grounded in what makes humanity so powerful yet so limited - the ability to narrow down the world to a manageable, narrow scope, and just live life the best we can.
        
        <br> <br>   The bathing ended at 3 AM, and I left feeling utterly renewed and refreshed. I drove a few minutes back up Highway 1 until I found a turn-off with no cars, and pulled over for the night. Clutching my knife in one hand and keys/pepper spray in the other, I fell asleep with the crashing waves still tickling my ears, and specks of light darting behind my closed eyelids. 
        
        <br> <br>   Despite the lack of planning and all the potential hang-ups, the three hour drive and the anxiety of going alone, this was an exceptional experience. And when I woke up after two and a half hours of sleep, this is the view I was greeted with: a perfect meld of sky and water.
